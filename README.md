# Vue.js Quizzes

This is a Vue.js application that presents a multiple-choice quiz to the user. The quiz is stored in an object called `quiz`, which includes various questions with their respective answer choices. The `app` object is a Vue instance that controls the behavior of the quiz. It stores the quiz data, the current question index, the user's answers, and whether or not the quiz is active.
